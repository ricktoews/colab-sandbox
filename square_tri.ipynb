        "The idea is to go through the triangular numbers and find any that are also squares. Such numbers are of some interest, as it can be observed that if Triangular(n) is square, then either (n) or (n+1) is square, and the other is twice a square. The reason this must be the case has to do with the fact that (n) and (n+1) are relatively prime. I imagine it's long been noted that if the product of two numbers that are relatively prime is a square, the two numbers are themselves square."
